# Laravel base API

This project's goal is to provide a clean, easy to understand and up to date API base. Basically, this is a default Laravel 12 install where everything not related to API is removed. The API accepts and answers in JSON only. This is the perfect starting point to work to build any Laravel based JSON API.
